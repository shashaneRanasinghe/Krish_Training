Missing Number

Write a Program to find the missing number in the series.
The series can start from any random number
The numbers in the series will have a difference of 1

Assumption - No characters will be in the sequence

Note - If the missing number does not exist within
the sequence the missing number can be either the 
number at the beginning of the sequence or the end
of the sequence. Therefore, if the number is either
at the beginning or the end of the sequence, I have 
assumed that the missing number is at the end of the
sequence
